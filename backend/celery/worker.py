"""Celery process. The compose service `worker` runs this; the API process does not.

Redis database 0 is the app's own keys (session locks, turn results, FX cache).
The broker is database 1 and task results are database 2, both derived from
`PARTNERDESK_REDIS_URL`, so there is no second URL to point at localhost.

A task runs here, after the request that enqueued it has finished. The chat
turn stays on the API's thread pool: that work is still inside the stream.
Side effects in a task have to be idempotent — the worker can retry.

Tasks live in `backend.tasks`. This process imports them once, at start.
The source tree is bind-mounted; `docker compose restart worker` picks up a change.
