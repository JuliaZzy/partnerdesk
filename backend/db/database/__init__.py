"""The one object the rest of the code talks to for persistence.

It speaks pydantic models (`backend/schemas/`) and plain dicts outward and SQLAlchemy
rows (`orm/`) inward — nothing outside this package imports `orm`. Every method is one
transaction; the multi-row writes (an order with its items and rule snapshot, a contract
with its terms and derived rules) commit together or not at all.

Construct it with a PostgreSQL URL, or nothing to use `config.db_url()`.
The schema is migrated to head on construction.

The methods live on mixins in this package so one file does not hold every table.
`Database` is still the only type callers construct.
